# Trig pillars spidermap

Using turf and mapbox to create dynamic hub and spoke maps. Using the code written by William B. Davis and then adapted by Garrett Dash Nelson. As you can probably tell, I barely know what I'm doing here - but I know just enough to make this work (with a little bit of extra help from Garrett).

I thought it would be interesting to do this, given the triangulation context here.
