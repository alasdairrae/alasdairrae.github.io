## Alasdair's Experimental Outputs

This page is really quite old and I haven't done anything with it, as you can see.

I will tidy things up one day, maybe.

### The rest of the text is just holding text for now

I'll edit this stuff in due course but for now I have no need to.

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alasdairrae/alasdairrae.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
